        <p style="margin-top: 3vh;color: white;font-size: 20px;margin-right: 5vw;">The universe (Latin: universus) is all of space and time[a] and their contents,[10] including planets, stars, galaxies,
        and all other forms of matter and energy. While the spatial size of the entire universe is unknown,[3] it is possible to
        measure the size of the observable universe, which is currently estimated to be 93 billion light-years in diameter. In
        various multiverse hypotheses, a universe is one of many causally disconnected[11] constituent parts of a larger
        multiverse, which itself comprises all of space and time and its contents.[12]<br><br>
        
        The earliest cosmological models of the universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers and were
        geocentric, placing Earth at the center.[13][14] Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led Nicolaus
        Copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the Sun at the center of the Solar System. In developing the law of
        universal gravitation, Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus's work as well as Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion
        and observations by Tycho Brahe.<br><br>
        
        Further observational improvements led to the realization that the Sun is one of hundreds of billions of stars in the
        Milky Way, which is one of at least two trillion galaxies in the universe. Many of the stars in our galaxy have planets.
        At the largest scale, galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the universe has
        neither an edge nor a center. At smaller scales, galaxies are distributed in clusters and superclusters which form
        immense filaments and voids in space, creating a vast foam-like structure.[15] Discoveries in the early 20th century
        have suggested that the universe had a beginning and that space has been expanding, since then,[16] and is currently
        still expanding at an increasing rate.[17]<br><br>
        
        The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological description of the development of the universe. According to
        estimation of this theory, space and time emerged together 13.799±0.021 billion years ago[2] and the energy and matter
        initially present have become less dense as the universe expanded. After an initial accelerated expansion called the
        inflationary epoch at around 10−32 seconds, and the separation of the four known fundamental forces, the universe
        gradually cooled and continued to expand, allowing the first subatomic particles and simple atoms to form. Dark matter
        gradually gathered, forming a foam-like structure of filaments and voids under the influence of gravity. Giant clouds of
        hydrogen and helium were gradually drawn to the places where dark matter was most dense, forming the first galaxies,
        stars, and everything else seen today. It is possible to see objects that are now further away than 13.799 billion
        light-years because space itself has expanded, and it is still expanding today. This means that objects which are now up
        to 46.5 billion light-years away can still be seen in their distant past, because in the past, when their light was
        emitted, they were much closer to Earth.<br><br>
        
        From studying the movement of galaxies, it has been discovered that the universe contains much more matter than is
        accounted for by visible objects; stars, galaxies, nebulas and interstellar gas. This unseen matter is known as dark
        matter[18] (dark means that there is a wide range of strong indirect evidence that it exists, but we have not yet
        detected it directly). The ΛCDM model is the most widely accepted model of our universe. It suggests that about
        69.2%±1.2% [2015] of the mass and energy in the universe is a cosmological constant (or, in extensions to ΛCDM, other
        forms of dark energy, such as a scalar field) which is responsible for the current expansion of space, and about
        25.8%±1.1% [2015] is dark matter.[19] Ordinary ('baryonic') matter is therefore only 4.84%±0.1% [2015] of the physical
        universe.[19] Stars, planets, and visible gas clouds only form about 6% of ordinary matter, or about 0.29% of the entire
        universe.[20]<br><br>
        
        There are many competing hypotheses about the ultimate fate of the universe and about what, if anything, preceded the
        Big Bang, while other physicists and philosophers refuse to speculate, doubting that information about prior states will
        ever be accessible. Some physicists have suggested various multiverse hypotheses, in which our universe might be one
        among many universes that likewise exist.<br><br></p>
