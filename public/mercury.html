            <p style="margin-top: 3vh;color: white;font-size: 20px;margin-right: 5vw;">The Sun is the star at the center
                of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma,[18][19] heated to
                incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly as light and infrared
                radiation. It
                is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million
                kilometres (864,000
                miles), or 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth. It accounts for
                about 99.86% of
                the total mass of the Solar System.[20] Roughly three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen
                (~73%); the rest
                is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon,
                neon, and iron.<br><br>

                The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V) based on its spectral class. As such, it is informally and
                not completely
                accurately referred to as a yellow dwarf (its light is closer to white than yellow). It formed
                approximately 4.6
                billion[a][14][22] years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large
                molecular cloud. Most
                of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the
                Solar System.
                The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. It is
                thought that
                almost all stars form by this process.<br><br>

                In its core the Sun currently fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium every second,
                converting 4 million
                tons of matter into energy every second as a result. This energy, which can take between 10,000 and
                170,000 years to
                escape the core, is the source of the Sun's light and heat. When hydrogen fusion in its core has
                diminished to the point
                at which the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, its core will undergo a marked increase in
                density and
                temperature while its outer layers expand, eventually transforming the Sun into a red giant. It is
                calculated that the
                Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of Mercury and Venus, and render Earth
                uninhabitable –
                but not for about five billion years. After this, it will shed its outer layers and become a dense type
                of cooling star
                known as a white dwarf, and no longer produce energy by fusion, but still glow and give off heat from
                its previous
                fusion.<br><br>

                The enormous effect of the Sun on Earth has been recognized since prehistoric times. The Sun has been
                regarded by some
                cultures as a deity. The synodic rotation of Earth and its orbit around the Sun are the basis of solar
                calendars, one of
                which is the predominant calendar in use today.<br><br></p>
